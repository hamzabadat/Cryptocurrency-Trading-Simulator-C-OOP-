# 📈 Cryptocurrency Trading Simulator (C++ OOP)

A **C++ Object-Oriented Programming project** that simulates a cryptocurrency trading environment using real historical market data loaded from a CSV file.

This simulator provides a console-based interface for exploring market statistics, generating candlestick data, and analyzing crypto price movement over time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Loads real crypto trading data from CSV files
- Menu-driven console application
- Object-oriented architecture with separate modules for:
  - Data management
  - CSV parsing
  - Candlestick generation (OHLC)
- Candlestick calculations for market visualization logic
- Clean separation of responsibilities using C++ classes

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**
- File I/O and CSV parsing
- Object-Oriented Design (classes, encapsulation)
- Data processing / market simulation logic

---

📊 Dataset

This project uses historical cryptocurrency market data stored in:

20200317.csv

You can replace this file with another dataset (same format) to simulate different market conditions.

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This project demonstrates important software engineering skills such as:

Writing modular C++ code using header/source files

Designing reusable classes

Parsing structured data (CSV)

Working with real-world datasets

Implementing market analysis logic like candlestick generation

---

💡 Possible Future Improvements

Add buy/sell order simulation and portfolio tracking

Add moving averages and indicators (RSI, MACD)

Export candlestick data into CSV output

Add support for multiple datasets and timeframes

Add a GUI front-end (Qt / web interface)
